# Python Maze Solver

# Description
This project is a Python-based maze generator and solver using Pygame. It generates a random maze using a depth-first search algorithm and solves it using the A* (A-Star) pathfinding algorithm.

# Features
1. Generates a random maze using depth-first search.
2. Solves the maze using the A* algorithm.
3. Uses Pygame for visualization.
4. Animated solution path highlighting.
